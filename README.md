## Problem Statement

This dashboard is a collected information of Sales Revenue from a semiconductor company, AT&S. The raw data is available publicly on the following website https://ats.net/en/investors/financial-reports-presentation/

The purpose of creating the dashboard is to study the trend of the company's revenue from the year 2017 up to 2022.

Based on the collected information it could be observed that:
* EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) dipped at 2019, which steadily recovered by 2022. This could be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic that greatly affected the semiconductor industry globally.
* Operating Free Cash Flow is highest on 2022 from selected year (2017-2022). It could be due to the effect of previous year after COVID-19 and some other investments made by that year.
