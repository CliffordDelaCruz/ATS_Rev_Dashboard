## Problem Statement

This dashboard is a collected information of Sales Revenue from a semiconductor company, AT&S. The raw data is available publicly on the following website https://ats.net/en/investors/financial-reports-presentation/

The purpose of creating the dashboard is to show the trend of the company's revenue from the year 2017 up to 2022.
Based on the collected information it could be observed that:
* EBIT (Earinings Before Interest and Earnings) dipped at 2019, which steadily recovered by 2022. This could be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic which greatly affected the industry.
*
